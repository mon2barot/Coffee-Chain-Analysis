# Data Science Project Overview: Coffee-Chain-Analysis
<b> The goal of the project is to conduct ad hoc analysis to extract business insights regarding products and inventory to aid in business decision making. </b>
<ul>
  <li> The dataset contains 3 tables viz; FactTable, LocationTable, and ProductTable. </li>
<li>The FactTable has been the focus of this project as it contains important information with approximately 4000 rows and 14 columns.The other tables have been used for the analysis too.</li>
<li>The quality of the data has been checked for inconsistencies using MS Access. The dataset was concluded to be clean.</li>
<li>Finally, with the help of Tableau's aggregate and filter functions numerous visualizations were created.</li>
<li>The analysis started by looking into product performances across states and moved onto rates as well as invenotry.</li>
</ul>

1. On the one hand Califronia, Iowa, and Colorado are the most profitable states and on the other hand New Mexico, New Hampshire, and Missouri are the least profitable states.
